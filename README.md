This extension makes specific style/layout changes to CiviCRM content for OSL.

* On the user dashboard, position Memberships above Contributions.
* On the user dashboard, present membership renewal links as buttons.
* On contribution pages where users would see a cms-user-help section, the sentences are re-ordered in that section section, so that user is prompted to login first, then suggested to create a username.
